# calibrated_meudon_data
This repository contains calibrated filament data which is made from Meudon hand drawn archive, which consist hand drawn Carrington maps in image format available at BASS2000: Solar Survey Archive at Observatoire de Paris (available at http://bass2000.obspm.fr/lastsynmap.php). The Meudon archive consisting gray scaled images for Carrington rotation 876-1823 and coloured images for Carrington rotation 1824-2008. After downloading the data from the Meudon archive, we have used a automated method (described in our paper in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04320.pdf) to calibrate these data and then we have used these calibrated data for further studies of solar filaments. Each calibrated map is in the Carrington longitude (x) vs latitude (y) grid and covers 360 degrees along x and 180 degrees along y. We are making these calibrated data public now and can be used for any further studies only after citing our paper Mazumder et al 2021.
